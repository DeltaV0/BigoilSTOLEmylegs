    //uhh im lowk tired and have no motivation rn soooo im gonna go to bed sry I will finish tmr

    //gonna just make a hotbar that you can hold the gun/flashlight/audio tapes in, ammo to load into a separate gun script, and MAYBE batteries for the flashlight if yall want that

    //keycardlevel is gonna be for upgrading the access you have to the map, that seems a lot easier that a bunch of different keys

    //} //sounds good lol
}
